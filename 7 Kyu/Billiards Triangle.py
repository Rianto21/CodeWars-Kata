"""
Remember the triangle of balls in billiards? To build a classic triangle (5 levels) you need 15 balls. With 3 balls you can build a 2-level triangle, etc.

For more examples,

pyramid(1) == 1

pyramid(3) == 2

pyramid(6) == 3

pyramid(10) == 4

pyramid(15) == 5
Write a function that takes number of balls (â‰¥ 1) and calculates how many levels you can build a triangle.
